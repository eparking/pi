# Raspberry Pi Code
The code used in led_update.py was used to pull data from the Flask server that was implemented. We used the RPi.GPIO to control the output pins for the Pi. In the picture "RBGLED.png" (credit: http://wiring.org.co/learning/basics/rgbled.html), we were able to figure out how to light up the LED!

The picture "Pi_Pins.png" was used to see how the pins were set up on the Raspberry Pi (credit: Google Images).
